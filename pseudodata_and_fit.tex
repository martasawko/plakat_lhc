We combine simulated signal and simulated background adjusting percentage rate of 
signal, using \textit{RooFit} tool dedicated for ROOT, relaying on background estimation. Fit is applied on every
$b$-tag category simultaneously.\\

While creating the systematics of the errors, we are taking into consideration the mistake of the trigger, momentum, offline
systematics, normalization and transfer factor.
We verify the efficiency of the fit, giving already the mixed data with a certain percentage rate, and checking
what rate and what statistical error the fit will give back.
