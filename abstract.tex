\begin{abstract}

The Standard Model of particle physics is one of the most thoroughly verified theories in science. But it has blind spots, it does not explain gravity, dark
matter and energy, or the baryon asymmetry. The drawbacks of the Standard Model motivate searches for Beyond
Standard Model physics. One class of theories, supersymmetry, predicts 4 additional Higgs bosons. This poster shows searches for two of those particles, $A^0$ and $H^0$ in
production states including additional b-quarks and in final states where $A^0$ and $H^0$ are decaying to a $b\bar{b}$ final state.
