During our research we relied on Monte Carlo method. 
Though events generated by Monte Carlo do not faithfully reflect reality,
they accurately reproduce signal to the background ratio.
The Monte Carlo events were generated way before the real data, according to the detector 
limitations and to the theoretical expectations from the Standard Model. 
Future work will comprise a comparison with the real data.
